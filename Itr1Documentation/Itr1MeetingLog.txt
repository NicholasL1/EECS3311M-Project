/-----------------------------/
SamePage Itr1 Meeting 1
February 3rd, 2023 @ 11:00 am
Attendance: Zohair, Kyle, Ammad, Nick, Nargis

Meeting Topic: Itr1 requirements analysis
	•	Discover deliverable priorities
	•	Understand who we need to reach out to as a team (Client team and developers)
	•	Zohair has been in contact with the client team through email/whatsapp
	•	Deliverable at the end of this iteration is a demo to the client which will be reviewed by February 16 during lab

Initial Design Architecture Discussion:
	•	Book class, will need to retrieve data from DB in future iterations
	•	User Class, this is where we obtain the information if the view is for a user logged in or if their a guest
	◦	i.e if user is logged in then they have different access such as adding book reviews and saving favourite books in future iterations
	◦	We need to consider best practices to allow flexibility and ease of modifying changes as next iteration will require refactoring
	•	Discuss how to interact with our interface:
	    ◦	Landing Page Display
	    ◦	Login/Register Display
	    ◦	Latest Book Releases Display

Tasks:
	•	Nick & Zohair: Find out what to use for GUI and Database access (Due: Feb 5)
	    ◦	Look into: JavaFX, JavaSpring, Hibernate, JavaAWT
	    •	Nick focuses on frameworks (what’s best for UI, what’s best for databases, etc) (Due: Feb 5)
        •	Zohair - communications, create dummy application (document as you go)
	•	Ammad, Nargis, Kyle looks into design architecture (Due: Feb 5)
	    ◦	Nargis focus on how they connect/interfaces
	    ◦	Focus on finding a reasonable design and tradeoffs


Summary of meeting:
Understand the requirements and begin initial planning + research for design architecture.

Itr1 Meeting 2
February 7th, 2023 @ 11:00 am
Attendance: Zohair, Kyle, Ammad, Nick, Nargis

Meeting Topics:
	•	Going through research notes - covered what MVC, MVP, and MVVM are, what are the pros, cons, differences (refer to itr1 Wiki for in depth research and justification)
	•	Team decision on design patterns
	◦	Decision made to use Model-View-Presenter - MVP since:
	◦	MVP builds on MVC design pattern and can easily apply this pattern to the architecture in Lecture week 3-1 slide 26
	◦	has a better separation of concerns
	◦	Presenter is not as tightly coupled as Controller, but has more responsibilities such as updating model and updating view
	◦	Presenter and Model follow Single Responsibility Principle better since Model is not in charge of updating Presenter
	◦	it is easier to unit test b/c of low coupling

	•	Team decision on what to use for interface, Java AWT vs. Java Swing vs. Java FX:
	◦	Decision made on using Java Swing(refer to Wiki for in depth comparisons). Some reasons include:
	◦	Swing has a wider library of UI components
	◦	Swing is an extension of JavaAWT, hence all AWT features are in Swing, yet it is more lightweight and has an improved performance
	◦	Swing easier to learn due to more resources available
	◦	Used for rapid efficient development of an app with easier access to GUI elements and libraries

	•	Class UML Design session -> using diagrams.net for initial UML class diagram to map out initial project components(refer to wiki or on github Itr1Documentation/ClassDiagrams.png for refined diagram)

	•	Used https://excalidraw.com/ for design wireframes and what project flow should look like(refer to wiki or on github Itr1Documentation/DesignWireFrame.png)

	•	Go over stories and prioritize developer tasks. Brief recap of stories:
Big User Stories:
	•	Landing Page - As a guest or member, I want to be able to open Same Page and view a number of books on the homepage.
	•	Search for Book - As a guest or member, I want to be able to search for a specific book.
	•	Register/Login - As a guest or member, I want to have the ability to register a new account with SamePage or login to an existing account.
Itr1 Detailed User Stories:
	•	Display Login/Register Buttons & Pop-ups - Display the login and register buttons and their corresponding pop-up input boxes on the landing page.
    •	Display Latest Releases - Display the most recent book releases of any genre on the landing page. Question: What external source can provide this information? 
    •	Search Bar - Display a search bar where text can be entered or filters can be applied to search for a book.
    •	Display Search Results - Display the results after searching for a book in the search bar.
    •	Login Existing User - Add functionality to securely log into Same Page with an existing email and password.
    •	Display Navbar - Create navbar component with login, register, clubs, and a profile icon.
    •	Register New User - Add functionality to register an account with an email, username, and password.
